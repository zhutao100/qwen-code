# Qwen Code: Terms of Service and Privacy Notice

Qwen Code is an open-source AI coding assistant tool maintained by the Qwen Code team. This document outlines the terms of service and privacy policies that apply when using Qwen Code's authentication methods and AI model services.

## How to determine your authentication method

Qwen Code supports two main authentication methods to access AI models. Your authentication method determines which terms of service and privacy policies apply to your usage:

1. **Qwen OAuth** - Log in with your qwen.ai account
2. **OpenAI-Compatible API** - Use API keys from various AI model providers

For each authentication method, different Terms of Service and Privacy Notices may apply depending on the underlying service provider.

| Authentication Method         | Provider            | Terms of Service                                                                                        | Privacy Notice                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## 1. If you are using Qwen OAuth Authentication

When you authenticate using your qwen.ai account, these Terms of Service and Privacy Notice documents apply:

- **Terms of Service:** Your use is governed by the [Qwen Terms of Service](https://qwen.ai/termsservice).
- **Privacy Notice:** The collection and use of your data is described in the [Qwen Privacy Policy](https://qwen.ai/privacypolicy).

**Key Features:**
- Free access to Qwen models
- 60 requests per minute, 2,000 requests per day
- Automatic credential refresh
- Seamless integration with Qwen AI services

## 2. If you are using OpenAI-Compatible API Authentication

When you authenticate using API keys from OpenAI-compatible providers, the applicable Terms of Service and Privacy Notice depend on your chosen provider:

**Common Providers:**
- **OpenAI:** [OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/terms/) and [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/)
- **Alibaba Cloud Bailian:** [Alibaba Cloud Terms of Service](https://www.alibabacloud.com/terms-of-use) and [Alibaba Cloud Privacy Policy](https://www.alibabacloud.com/privacy-policy)
- **ModelScope:** [ModelScope Terms of Service](https://modelscope.cn/terms) and [ModelScope Privacy Policy](https://modelscope.cn/privacy)
- **OpenRouter:** [OpenRouter Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms) and [OpenRouter Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)
- **Azure OpenAI:** [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement/) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement)

**Important:** When using OpenAI-compatible API authentication, you are subject to the terms and privacy policies of your chosen provider, not Qwen Code's terms. Please review your provider's documentation for specific details about data usage, retention, and privacy practices.

## Usage Statistics and Telemetry

Qwen Code may collect anonymous usage statistics and telemetry data to improve the user experience and product quality. This data collection is optional and can be controlled through configuration settings.

### What Data is Collected

When enabled, Qwen Code may collect:
- Anonymous usage statistics (commands run, performance metrics)
- Error reports and crash data
- Feature usage patterns

### Data Collection by Authentication Method

- **Qwen OAuth:** Usage statistics are governed by Qwen's privacy policy. You can opt-out through Qwen Code's configuration settings.
- **OpenAI-Compatible API:** No additional data is collected by Qwen Code beyond what your chosen API provider collects.

### Opt-Out Instructions

You can disable usage statistics collection by following the instructions in the [Usage Statistics Configuration](./cli/configuration.md#usage-statistics) documentation.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Is my code, including prompts and answers, used to train AI models?

Whether your code, including prompts and answers, is used to train AI models depends on your authentication method and the specific AI service provider you use:

- **Qwen OAuth**: Data usage is governed by [Qwen's Privacy Policy](https://qwen.ai/privacy). Please refer to their policy for specific details about data collection and model training practices.

- **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Data usage depends entirely on your chosen API provider:
  - **OpenAI**: Refer to [OpenAI's data usage policies](https://openai.com/privacy/) for information about how your data is used
  - **Other providers**: Each provider (Alibaba Cloud, ModelScope, OpenRouter, etc.) has their own data usage policies. Please review the privacy policy of your specific provider.

**Important**: Qwen Code itself does not use your prompts, code, or responses for model training. Any data usage for training purposes would be governed by the policies of the AI service provider you authenticate with.

### 2. What are Usage Statistics and what does the opt-out control?

The **Usage Statistics** setting controls optional data collection by Qwen Code for improving the user experience and product quality.

When enabled, Qwen Code may collect:
- Anonymous telemetry (commands run, performance metrics, feature usage)
- Error reports and crash data
- General usage patterns

**What is NOT collected by Qwen Code:**
- Your code content
- Prompts sent to AI models
- Responses from AI models
- Personal information

The Usage Statistics setting only controls data collection by Qwen Code itself. It does not affect what data your chosen AI service provider (Qwen, OpenAI, etc.) may collect according to their own privacy policies.

You can disable Usage Statistics collection by following the instructions in the [Usage Statistics Configuration](./cli/configuration.md#usage-statistics) documentation.

### 3. How do I switch between authentication methods?

You can switch between Qwen OAuth and OpenAI-compatible API authentication at any time:

1. **During startup**: Choose your preferred authentication method when prompted
2. **Within the CLI**: Use the `/auth` command to reconfigure your authentication method
3. **Environment variables**: Set up `.env` files for automatic OpenAI-compatible API authentication

For detailed instructions, see the [Authentication Setup](./cli/authentication.md) documentation.
