# Agent Skills (Experimental)

> Create, manage, and share Skills to extend Qwen Code’s capabilities.

This guide shows you how to create, use, and manage Agent Skills in **Qwen Code**. Skills are modular capabilities that extend the model’s effectiveness through organized folders containing instructions (and optionally scripts/resources).

> [!note]
>
> Skills are currently **experimental** and must be enabled with `--experimental-skills`.

## Prerequisites

- Qwen Code (recent version)
- Run with the experimental flag enabled:

```bash
qwen --experimental-skills
```

- Basic familiarity with Qwen Code ([Quickstart](../quickstart))

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills package expertise into discoverable capabilities. Each Skill consists of a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that the model can load when relevant, plus optional supporting files like scripts and templates.

### How Skills are invoked

Skills are **model-invoked** — the model autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill’s description. This is different from slash commands, which are **user-invoked** (you explicitly type `/command`).

### Benefits

- Extend Qwen Code for your workflows
- Share expertise across your team via git
- Reduce repetitive prompting
- Compose multiple Skills for complex tasks

## Create a Skill

Skills are stored as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file.

### Personal Skills

Personal Skills are available across all your projects. Store them in `~/.qwen/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.qwen/skills/my-skill-name
```

Use personal Skills for:

- Your individual workflows and preferences
- Experimental Skills you’re developing
- Personal productivity helpers

### Project Skills

Project Skills are shared with your team. Store them in `.qwen/skills/` within your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .qwen/skills/my-skill-name
```

Use project Skills for:

- Team workflows and conventions
- Project-specific expertise
- Shared utilities and scripts

Project Skills can be checked into git and automatically become available to teammates.

## Write `SKILL.md`

Create a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions
Provide clear, step-by-step guidance for Qwen Code.

## Examples
Show concrete examples of using this Skill.
```

### Field requirements

Qwen Code currently validates that:

- `name` is a non-empty string
- `description` is a non-empty string

Recommended conventions (not strictly enforced yet):

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens in `name`
- Make `description` specific: include both **what** the Skill does and **when** to use it (key words users will naturally mention)

## Add supporting files

Create additional files alongside `SKILL.md`:

```text
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── reference.md (optional documentation)
├── examples.md (optional examples)
├── scripts/
│   └── helper.py (optional utility)
└── templates/
    └── template.txt (optional template)
```

Reference these files from `SKILL.md`:

````markdown
For advanced usage, see [reference.md](reference.md).

Run the helper script:

```bash
python scripts/helper.py input.txt
```
````

## View available Skills

When `--experimental-skills` is enabled, Qwen Code discovers Skills from:

- Personal Skills: `~/.qwen/skills/`
- Project Skills: `.qwen/skills/`

To view available Skills, ask Qwen Code directly:

```text
What Skills are available?
```

Or inspect the filesystem:

```bash
# List personal Skills
ls ~/.qwen/skills/

# List project Skills (if in a project directory)
ls .qwen/skills/

# View a specific Skill’s content
cat ~/.qwen/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

## Test a Skill

After creating a Skill, test it by asking questions that match your description.

Example: if your description mentions “PDF files”:

```text
Can you help me extract text from this PDF?
```

The model autonomously decides to use your Skill if it matches the request — you don’t need to explicitly invoke it.

## Debug a Skill

If Qwen Code doesn’t use your Skill, check these common issues:

### Make the description specific

Too vague:

```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```

Specific:

```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

### Verify file path

- Personal Skills: `~/.qwen/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Project Skills: `.qwen/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

```bash
# Personal
ls ~/.qwen/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Project
ls .qwen/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

### Check YAML syntax

Invalid YAML prevents the Skill metadata from loading correctly.

```bash
cat SKILL.md | head -n 15
```

Ensure:

- Opening `---` on line 1
- Closing `---` before Markdown content
- Valid YAML syntax (no tabs, correct indentation)

### View errors

Run Qwen Code with debug mode to see Skill loading errors:

```bash
qwen --experimental-skills --debug
```

## Share Skills with your team

You can share Skills through project repositories:

1. Add the Skill under `.qwen/skills/`
2. Commit and push
3. Teammates pull the changes and run with `--experimental-skills`

```bash
git add .qwen/skills/
git commit -m "Add team Skill for PDF processing"
git push
```

## Update a Skill

Edit `SKILL.md` directly:

```bash
# Personal Skill
code ~/.qwen/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Project Skill
code .qwen/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

Changes take effect the next time you start Qwen Code. If Qwen Code is already running, restart it to load the updates.

## Remove a Skill

Delete the Skill directory:

```bash
# Personal
rm -rf ~/.qwen/skills/my-skill

# Project
rm -rf .qwen/skills/my-skill
git commit -m "Remove unused Skill"
```

## Best practices

### Keep Skills focused

One Skill should address one capability:

- Focused: “PDF form filling”, “Excel analysis”, “Git commit messages”
- Too broad: “Document processing” (split into smaller Skills)

### Write clear descriptions

Help the model discover when to use Skills by including specific triggers:

```yaml
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or .xlsx data.
```

### Test with your team

- Does the Skill activate when expected?
- Are the instructions clear?
- Are there missing examples or edge cases?
