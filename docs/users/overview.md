> Learn about Qwen Code, Qwen's agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.

## Get started in 30 seconds

Prerequisites:

- A [Qwen Code](https://chat.qwen.ai/auth?mode=register) account
- Requires [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/download), you can use `node -v` to check the version. If it's not installed, use the following command to install it.

> **New VS Code Extension (Beta)**: Prefer a graphical interface? Our new **VS Code extension** provides an easy-to-use native IDE experience without requiring terminal familiarity. Simply install from the marketplace and start coding with Qwen Code directly in your sidebar. You can search for **Qwen Code** in the VS Code Marketplace and download it.

## What Qwen Code does for you

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Qwen Code what you want to build in plain language. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Qwen Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Qwen Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/users/features/mcp) can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.

## Why developers love Qwen Code

- **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Qwen Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
- **Takes action**: Qwen Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](/users/features/mcp) lets Qwen Code read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use _your_ custom developer tooling.
- **Unix philosophy**: Qwen Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | qwen -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` _works_. Your CI can run `qwen -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
