# Qwen Code

![Qwen Code Screenshot](./docs/assets/qwen-screenshot.png)

Qwen Code is a command-line AI workflow tool adapted from [**Gemini CLI**](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)(Please refer to [this document](./README.gemini.md) for more details), optimized for Qwen-Coder models with enhanced parser support & tool support.

## Key Features

- **Code Understanding & Editing** - Query and edit large codebases beyond traditional context window limits
- **Workflow Automation** - Automate operational tasks like handling pull requests and complex rebases
- **Enhanced Parser** - Adapted parser specifically optimized for Qwen-Coder models

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.

```bash 
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code
qwen --version
```

Then run from anywhere:

```bash
qwen
```

Or you can install it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwen-code/qwen-code.git
cd qwen-code
npm install
npm install -g .
```

### API Configuration

Set your Qwen API key (In Qwen Code project, you can also set your API key in `.env` file):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="your_api_base_url_here"
export OPENAI_MODEL="your_api_model_here"
```

## Usage Examples

### Explore Codebases

```sh
cd your-project/
qwen
> Describe the main pieces of this system's architecture
```

### Code Development

```sh
> Refactor this function to improve readability and performance
```

### Automate Workflows

```sh
> Analyze git commits from the last 7 days, grouped by feature and team member
```

```sh
> Convert all images in this directory to PNG format
```

## Popular Tasks

### Understand New Codebases

```text
> What are the core business logic components?
> What security mechanisms are in place?
> How does the data flow work?
```

### Code Refactoring & Optimization

```text
> What parts of this module can be optimized?
> Help me refactor this class to follow better design patterns
> Add proper error handling and logging
```

### Documentation & Testing

```text
> Generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for this function
> Write unit tests for this component
> Create API documentation
```
